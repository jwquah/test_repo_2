# Introduction to Python
 + An interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming
 + Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
  + Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace
 + Python is scalable and offers flexibility allowing one to write a code for something as simple as file-based processing to data analysis leveraging on modules such as pandas and numpy.

---

## Expectations
+ Python is installed
 + If not, download from [www.python.org](www.python.org)
 + Alternatively, consider packaged distributions such as Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ which contains Python that can be launched via Jupyter.
 + Familiar with basic programming terms
+ This repository contains a set of direct samples for daily Python use.


## A few basic notes...
For those with some background in other programming languages, here's the lowdown for Python:
+ Be **CONSISTENT**:
 + It is space and tab sensitive - mixing spaces and tabs are not allowed
 + Using a single quote (') or double quotes (") makes no difference
+ Python 3 requires any print statement to be in brackets while it is optional in previous versions

### TODO:
+ Work on Regex
