### Flow Control
+ **Break**   : Exits out of the loop if condition is met
+ **Continue**: Returns control to the loop and proceeds to the next if condition is met


```python
print('Looping from 0 to 10, exiting if value = 5')
var = 0                    
while var < 10:              
   var= var +1
   if var == 5:
      break
   print (var)




```

   var= var +1
   if var == 5:
      continue
